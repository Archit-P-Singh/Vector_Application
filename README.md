# Vector Application

The **Vector Application** is a Java-based program designed to perform various vector operations. It provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to easily compute vector-related calculations such as dot product, cross product, magnitude, and more.

## Features

- **Dot Product Calculation**: Compute the dot product between two vectors.
- **Cross Product Calculation**: Find the cross product of two vectors.
- **Magnitude Calculation**: Calculate the magnitude (length) of a vector.
- **Vector Addition**: Add two vectors together.
- **Unit Vector Calculation**: Compute the unit vector of a given vector.
- **Vector Subtraction**: Calculate the difference between two vectors.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Archit-P-Singh/Vector_Application.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Vector_Application
3. **Open the project in your preferred Java IDE** (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).
4. **Run the application**: Open and run the Main.java file to launch the application.

## Requirements
1. **Java 8** or higher.
2. A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) to run the application.

## Usage
Once the application is launched:

1. The GUI will prompt you to choose the vector operation you wish to perform.
2. Enter the vector components as requested.
3. The application will display the result of the operation (e.g., the calculated dot product, cross product, etc.).
